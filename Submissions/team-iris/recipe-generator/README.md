# 🍳 AI Ingredient-Based Recipe Creator

## Overview

**AI Ingredient-Based Recipe Creator** is an intelligent cooking assistant powered by **Gemini AI**.  
Instead of searching for recipes online, users simply enter the **ingredients they have**, and the AI instantly generates a **delicious recipe** — complete with **a custom AI-generated image** of the dish and **step-by-step cooking instructions**.

This project aims to reduce food waste and make home cooking easier, faster, and more creative.

## How It Works

1. The user lists their **available ingredients** (e.g., _chicken, rice, tomato_).
2. The app sends the prompt to **Gemini AI**.
3. Gemini analyzes the ingredients and generates:
   - A **unique recipe** using only those ingredients.
   - A **realistic AI-generated image** of the final dish.
   - A **step-by-step guide** for preparation and cooking.
4. The recipe is displayed in a clean, minimal interface ready for saving or sharing.
