## üè• ML Task: Hospital Readmission Prediction

### Scenario
Hospitals face challenges with patients being readmitted within 30 days after discharge, leading to increased healthcare costs and quality concerns. Build a predictive model to identify high-risk patients based on demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and medication history.

### Objective
Develop a binary classification model that predicts 30-day hospital readmission, enabling clinicians to implement preventive interventions and reduce avoidable readmissions.

### Task Breakdown

**1. Data Preprocessing**
- Clean data (remove duplicates, handle missing values like `?`)
- Convert multi-class target to binary:
  - `<30` (readmitted within 30 days) ‚Üí `1`
  - `NO` or `>30` (not readmitted) ‚Üí `0`
- Handle categorical variables and encoding
- Address class imbalance if present

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyze relationships between readmission and key features:
  - Age groups
  - Number of medications
  - Diagnosis codes
  - Length of hospital stay
  - Number of procedures
- Identify high-risk patient groups
- Visualize distributions and correlations

**3. Feature Engineering**
- Create meaningful features:
  - **Polypharmacy indicator**: `num_medications > threshold`
  - **Chronic illness flags**: Extract from diagnosis codes
  - **Procedure count**: Total past procedures/admissions
  - **Age categories**: Group patients by age ranges
  - **Medication changes**: Track insulin/diabetes medication adjustments
- Feature selection and importance analysis

**4. Model Development**
- Train multiple classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost / LightGBM
  - Neural Networks (optional)
- Use stratified cross-validation
- Optimize for **Recall** or **F1-score** (minimize false negatives)
- Handle class imbalance (SMOTE, class weights)

**5. Model Evaluation**
- Performance metrics:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Classification Report
- Compare models and select best performer
- Validate on holdout test set

**6. Model Interpretation**
- Use SHAP values or feature importance
- Identify key drivers of readmission
- Highlight controllable risk factors for intervention
- Generate patient risk profiles

**7. Bonus: Subgroup Analysis**
- Segment population by age groups
- Evaluate model performance across demographics
- Identify vulnerable populations
- Provide targeted recommendations

### Deliverables
‚úÖ **Clean, commented code** (Jupyter/Colab notebook)  
‚úÖ **Visual EDA plots** (bar charts, heatmaps, boxplots, distributions)  
‚úÖ **Performance metrics** (confusion matrix, ROC curve, F1 score)  
‚úÖ **Model interpretation** (SHAP plots, feature importance)  
‚úÖ **Key takeaways** for hospital management with actionable insights  
‚úÖ **Documentation** explaining methodology and findings  

### Expected Insights
- Which patient characteristics predict readmission?
- What are the top controllable risk factors?
- How can hospitals prioritize high-risk patients?
- What interventions could reduce readmission rates?

### Clinical Impact
- Reduce healthcare costs
- Improve patient outcomes
- Optimize resource allocation
- Enable proactive care management
